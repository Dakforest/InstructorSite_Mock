This project is intended to be a practice project for HTMl and CSS. 
At the time of starting this project, I don't intend to use Javascript 
or another scripting language. The contact page will have a form, but there 
will be no scripting behind that form.  -- 5/10/20, Dak

In working with this project, I researched how to maintain the code for the
header and footer on separate document, so that editing code on one document
cascaded to all other pages. My solution was to use javascript to insert 
the header and footer codes into the web pages. -- 8/16/2020, Dak
