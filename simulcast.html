						<h2>What is a Simulcast</h2>
						<p>Simulcast Classes are open both to traditional students inside the classroom and to students participating online.</p>
						<p>The instructor will teach class normally using Powerpoints, the student manual, and handouts. The session will be broadcast through Microsoft Teams conference call service. Remote students will be able to see and hear the instructor, as well as the powerpoint, videos, etc. </p>
						<p>Remote Students will participate via chat, which will be on the instructor's primary monitor. If there is a test at the end of the class, the remote students will be able to take it online. </p>
