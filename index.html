					<h2>Green Monarch Training Institute</h2>
					<p>The Green Monarch Training Institute offers compliance assistance training for those managing environmental challenges or implementing environmental regulations in Air, Waste, Water and Management. Through training and education, you or your employees can play an active role in your sustainable compliance strategy. Visits from the EPA can be extremely expensive. Avoid paying penalties by educating your workforce. Courses can be taken individually or in support of certificate programs. Finally, with contract or on-site training, we bring the course materials and experts to your facility, customizing the curriculum for your business, on a schedule that is convenient for your operations.</p>
